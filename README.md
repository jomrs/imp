## what is this?
silly code to calculate product values and taxes from buying on marketplaces outside Brazil.
this uses [Api de Moedas](https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/api-de-moedas) to get the USD-REAL cotation.

most of informations about the taxes are in code as comments, if you are curious about the calc.
